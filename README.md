# ca-ozone-analysis
This project cleans and analyzes a 54k-row EPA ozone dataset. After a deep cleaning process, our analysis of time-based trends confirmed that pollution spikes in summer. A geographic analysis using a folium map pinpointed hotspots in Southern California and the Central Valley. We also found data integrity issues between monitoring methods.
